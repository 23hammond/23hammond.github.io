          <h2> Cryptography in Ancient History </h2>
          <p> For as long as humans have existed, the need to communicate has been part of our essence. And, for just as long, the need to communicate with select parties has been a necessity as well. When we fight wars, making our messages confusing until undeciphered by a select group of people who understand their meanings has been vital to keeping one side's information out of the enemy's hands.</p>
          <p> The story of cryptography begins in Egypt with <strong>hieroglyphs</strong>. Only the select few scribes who had the ability to read and write knew how to interpret hieroglyphs, which was vital for the scribes transmissing messages on behalf of their kings. </p>
          <p> Another example of ancient cryptography is the aforementioned <strong>scytale</strong> from ancient Greece, wherein the scrambled letters are written on a long sheet of leather, and can be interpreted by wrapping the strip around a wooden bar and reading the strip in horizontal lines. The word "cryptography" itself comes from the Greek words "krypto" and "graphene" respectively, meaning "hidden writing". </p>

          <h2> Cryptography and the Latin Alphabet </h2>
          <p> Later on in history, the hieroglyph of old would largely be replaced by <strong>alphabets</strong>, which brings us to Europe, where the <strong>Latin alphabet</strong> emerged. This would give birth to <strong>subsitution</strong> ciphers such as the <strong>Caesar cipher</strong>, where all the letters in a sentence were shifted a specific number of letters in sequence forwards or backwards.
          <p> However, an enemy getting ahold of a encrypted message turns them on to the idea that there is in fact secret information going around. The next obvious step in this process is to remove suspicion of any ciphers to crack to begin with, which led to the invention of <strong>steganography</strong>, a term first used in 1499 in polymath Johannes Trithemius' book <i>Steganographia</i>. This process can be accomplished in both physical and digital documents. </p>
          <p> Alongside the secrecy of the encrypted message increasing, the difficulty of deciphering these messages increased as well. The Caesar cipher's harder to solve brother is the <strong>Vigenère cipher</strong>, invention of <strong>Giovan Battista Bellaso</strong>, but named for <strong>Blaise de Vigenère</strong> to whom it was misattributed in the 19th century.</p>
          <p> Following the second World War, cryptography would become much more mathematical with the subsequent advancement of computers.</p>
