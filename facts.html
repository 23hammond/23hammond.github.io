            <li> Cryptography wasn't even necessary when written language was first being invented, as literacy was in of itself a very obscure skill that only royalty and scribes would know about for the most part. The need for cryptography only came once the common man could learn to read. </li>
            <li> The word "cryptography" comes from a portmanteau of two Greek words. (Krypt√≥s and Graphein, literally "hidden writing") </li>
            <li> Though the two words were more or less interchangable in the pass, "Cryptography" today tends be more oriented towards mathematics and computer science, while "encryption" is just a subset of cryptography, usually applied when talking about language. </li>
