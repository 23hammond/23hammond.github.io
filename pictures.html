         <p> Say, for the sake of example, I wanted to send the message "attack at midnight" in secret, and use the <strong>key</strong> "Basil". After letting the recipient know of the key, I would start <strong>encrypting</strong>. For the first letter, I would find the letter at the intersection of the 'A' row and 'B' column (for the phrase and key respectively), which gives me 'B'. I continue this process until all letters have been encrypted, going back to the start of the keyword whenever I go through the whole keyword. (For example, I would encrypt the message with the letters <strong>BASILB AS ILBASILB</strong>.)</p>
         <p> The encrypted message from this example would end up being "<strong>Btlinl al utenaosu</strong>". To <strong>decrypt</strong> it knowing the key, I would start on the first letter by finding where the 'B' is on the 'B' column. In our case it is in the 'A' row, which makes sense as the first letter of "Attack at midnight" is 'A'. </p>
