           <figcaption>Though "Satoshi Nakamoto" is the pseudonym of the person or collective who invented Bitcoin and the blockchain, it is also the name of a real Japanese man who gained media attention after Bitcoin entered the public eye, people having mistook him for the inventor(s) of the currency. </figcaption>

         <p> As <strong>cryptocurrency</strong> becomes accepted as a payment method in more locations worldwide, it is of no doubt that cryptocurrency is here to stay. Perhaps the anonymous, decentralized bank that the inventor(s) of the <storng>blockchain</strong> and <strong>Bitcoin</strong>, <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong>, intended while developing these technologies. </p>
         <p> As <strong>quantum computing</strong> becomes both more developed and more known to the public, cryptography as we know it today could be at risk. While today's computers would operate iteratively (testing every combination of characters for a key), quantum computers are said to operate much differently, and this could spell disaster if quantum computing technology got into the wrong hands. In 1994, Peter Shor wrote an algorithm for quantum computers that would break the encryption we use today as we know it, so cryptologists need to come up with some sort of solution, and fast. </p>
